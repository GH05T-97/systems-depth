The old fence posts are leaning,
their grey wood soft and worn.
A single black-eyed susan
has survived the latest storm.

The grass is wet with morning,
and a cricket starts to sing,
a tiny, rusty fiddle
on a thread of silver string.

The barn door hangs a little,
off its hinge against the sky.
It's a quiet kind of moment,
not a hurry, not a why.

Just the earth, and me, and summer,
in a language slow and deep,
where the only thought worth thinking
is the promise that we keep.
