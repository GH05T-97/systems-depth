# Systems Depth Engineering

A 12-month journey from cloud engineer to elite systems engineer.

---

## 🎯 Mission

Build deep expertise in:
- **Rust systems programming** (memory, unsafe, FFI, concurrency)
- **OS internals** (Linux & Windows: processes, memory, syscalls)
- **Networking** (packets to protocols: TCP/IP, raw sockets)
- **Security** (exploitation, injection, detection, defense)

Not learning frameworks. Learning what's underneath.

## 📁 Structure
systems-depth/
├── phase1-rust/ # Months 1-4: Rust mastery & systems programming
├── phase2-os/ # Months 5-7: OS internals (Linux/Windows)
├── phase3-networks/ # Months 8-9: Networks & low-level comms
├── phase4-security/ # Months 10-12: Security engineering
└── blog-posts/ # Published writing


Each phase contains:
- `/notes/` - Concepts I'm learning
- `/projects/` - Working code with READMEs

## 🗺️ Roadmap

| Phase | Focus | Projects |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Rust depth | CLI tool, FFI bindings, custom allocator, network service |
| 2 | OS internals | System info tool, process monitor, PE/ELF parser |
| 3 | Networking | Packet sniffer, recon tool, epoll wrapper |
| 4 | Security | Exploit lab, injection suite, EDR simulator, C2 framework, detection tool |

## 📚 Core Resources

**Books:**
- The Rust Programming Language
- Rust for Rustaceans
- Linux Kernel Development (Love)
- Windows Internals (Yosifovich)

## ⚠️ Ethics

Security code is **educational only**. Run in isolated labs. Never use against systems I don't own. Studying offense to build better defense.
